## 🧩 System Overview

The **5D-RAG** framework **decomposes retrieval into five optimizers**, each responsible for a distinct stage of query understanding, retrieval, and response generation.  
This **agent-based decomposition** allows for:

- 🎯 **Fine-Grained Control**: Optimization at multiple levels of the pipeline  
- 🔄 **Continuous Self-Improvement**: Automated adjustments through online learning  
- 🌐 **Robust Generalization**: Seamless adaptation to **dynamic knowledge updates** and **heterogeneous enterprise data**
